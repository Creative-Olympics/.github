    Creative Olmpyics is a charity event based on Minecraft in which several teams from all around the world will compete during one week in multiple domains. With 4 to 6 people in each team, they will have to create an entire map on a specific theme and with some constraints in addition of participating each day in creative jams or pvp contests. Time management and organization are the key of success during this event where everything is designed to push the crativity to an e-sport level. During this week, spectators can make gifts in order to support there team, get badges, cosmetics or reach donation goals. All the money goes to an ONG which will be announced before the start.

Communication need at least 4 month and need all the technical part to be done. In other word, as the best time to do such kind of event is july, all the technical part should be done in february od the same year.
