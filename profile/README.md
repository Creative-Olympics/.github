    The Creative Olympics is a charity event based on Minecraft in which teams from all around the world compete against each other over the course of a week, in multiple domains. With 4 to 6 people in each team, they will have to create an entire map based on a specific theme and with some constraints, in addition to participating in daily creative jams or PvP contests. Time management and organization are the keys to success during this event, where everything is designed to push crativity to an e-sports level! During this week, spectators can make donations to support their team, get badges, cosmetics, or reach donation goals. All the money will go to an ONG that will be announced before the start of the event.

We use the agile methodology. We thus define sprints, which are basically 3 weeks during which we work on the small tasks we defined at the beginning of the sprint, and we have a meeting at the end to see the progress and make sure everyone has everything they need to do the job. During these three weeks, each leader is free to organize the work in the way they feels most convenient.

<br>
<div align=center>
<h3>Every 3 weeks, on Wednesday at 8pm (UTC+2), we have a meeting during which we share all the progress of all the parts. Leaders must be present.</h3>
