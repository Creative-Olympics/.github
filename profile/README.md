    Creative Olmpyics is a charity event based on Minecraft in which several teams from all around the world will compete during one week in multiple domains. With 4 to 6 people in each team, they will have to create an entire map on a specific theme and with some constraints in addition of participating each day in creative jams or pvp contests. Time management and organization are the key of success during this event where everything is designed to push the crativity to an e-sport level. During this week, spectators can make gifts in order to support there team, get badges, cosmetics or reach donation goals. All the money goes to an ONG which will be announced before the start.

- **☁️ Network** infrasctructure (currently leaded by Neïl)
- **🤖 Discord bot** in python to link the website to the server (currently leaded by Z_runner)
- **🔌 Minecraft plugin** for event contests (currently leaded by Syl2010)
- **🧱 Build** of a map which will be hosted on a public server (which doesn't have leader for now)
- **📂 Datapack** to make some minigames on the public server (currently leaded by Leirof)
- **🗿 Ressource pack** for all the event (leaded by fantomitechno)
- **🎆 Ceremonies** which will take place on the public map (leaded by JeffWooden_)
- **📢 Communication** (not started yet)

Communication need at least 4 month and need all the technical part to be done. In other word, as the best time to do such kind of event is july, all the technical part should be done in february od the same year. To be safe, we consider that technical part have to be done 6 month before, so in december.

## Organization

We are using the agile methode. We then define sprints, which are basically 3 weeks during which we work on the small objectives we fixed at the begining of the sprint and we do a meeting at the end to see the progress and ensure everyone have everything need to do the job.
