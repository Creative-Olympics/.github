    Creative Olmpyics is a charity event based on Minecraft in which several teams from all around the world will compete during one week in multiple domains. With 4 to 6 people in each team, they will have to create an entire map on a specific theme and with some constraints in addition of participating each day in creative jams or pvp contests. Time management and organization are the key of success during this event where everything is designed to push the crativity to an e-sport level. During this week, spectators can make gifts in order to support there team, get badges, cosmetics or reach donation goals. All the money goes to an ONG which will be announced before the start.

<p>
<b>📢 Communication</b><br>
&emsp;To let the world now this amazing event exist and show them that they need to take part of it! This part will start later.
</p>

Communication need at least 4 month and need all the technical part to be done. In other word, as the best time to do such kind of event is july, all the technical part should be done in february od the same year. To be safe, we consider that technical part have to be done 6 month before, so in december.

## Organization

We are using the agile methode. We then define sprints, which are basically 3 weeks during which we work on the small objectives we fixed at the begining of the sprint and we do a meeting at the end to see the progress and ensure everyone have everything need to do the job. During these three weeks, each leader is free to organize the work in the way he juidge the most conveniant.

<h3>Every 3 weeks, on wednesday at 8pm (UTC+2) we do a meeting during which we share all the progress of all parts. Leaders have to come.</h3>
